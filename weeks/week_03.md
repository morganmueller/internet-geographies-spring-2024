**READING DUE MONDAY**
    * [Joseph Dummit, "Writing The Implosion"](https://journal.culanth.org/index.php/ca/article/view/ca29.2.09/301) 

* **SMALL ASSIGNMENT (DUE MARCH 22nd)**
    *  At least once a week for the next four weeks, revisit one of the sites you chose in the first small exercise where you identified public components of networked infrastructure (for at least 20 minutes per visit). This time the goal will be to practice the 'art of noticing,' focusing on the piece of internet infrastructure and creatively document what you notice. This documentation could be in the form of a field guide, audio field recording, journal or any other method you'd like.
    
    Some potential things to think about while at the location are how people interact with the piece of internet infrastructure, if at all, what dynamics it brings to the area it's located in, and if other non-human actors interact with it. We will spend a portion of **March 22nd's** class discussing each student's documentation.
