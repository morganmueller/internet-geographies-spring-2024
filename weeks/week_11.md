# Week 11 - Politics of Production

> "To call the Apple iPhone a fetish is only to state the obvious. It is, specifically, a commodity fetish. However, it is a special kind of digital fetish: a commodity that enjoys some of the special and exalted social status of a noncommodity" - Nakamura

* **SMALL ASSIGNMENT**
    * Spend the next week collecting a personal dataset and use datawrapper to visualize it. This personal dataset could be anything you'd like. For example you could log each of your meal times, download an app which tracks and logs how much time you spend on your phone/computer, keep track of which routes you take going to school, the number of times you say certain words or perform certain actions etc. During next Wednesday's class we will spend some time looking at each person's visualization and discussing what stories they can infer from those data.
