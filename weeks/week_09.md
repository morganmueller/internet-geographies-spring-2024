# Week 9 - Rethinking Containerization

> “The sea is forgotten until disaster strikes. But perhaps the biggest seagoing disaster is the global supply chain, which — maybe in a more fundamental way than financial speculation — leads the world economy to the abyss.” ― Sekula (2000)

> "In the absence of real efforts to create democratic oversight of supply chains, we’ve come to see them as operating autonomously—more like natural forces than forces that we’ve created ourselves." - Posner (2018)
